The presented framework is based on a standardized, and freely available library and in the published form it solves the minimum compliance problem on structured grids, using standard FEM and filtering techniques. For completeness a parallel implementation of the Method of Moving Asymptotes is included as well. The capabilities are exemplified by minimum compliance and homogenization problems. In both cases the unprecedented fine discretization reveals new design features, providing novel insight. The code can be downloaded from www. topopt. dtu. dk/ PETSc.},

Design of meta-atoms, the fundamental building blocks of metasurfaces, relies on trial-and-error method to achieve target electromagnetic responses. This process includes the characterization of an enormous amount of different meta-atom designs with different physical and geometric parameters, which normally demands huge computational resources. In this paper, a deep learning-based metasurface/meta-atom modeling approach is introduced to significantly reduce the characterization time while maintaining accuracy. Based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) structure, the proposed deep learning network is able to model meta-atoms with freeform 2D patterns and different lattice sizes, material refractive indexes and thicknesses. Moreover, the presented approach features the capability to predict meta-atoms' wide spectrum responses in the timescale of milliseconds, which makes it attractive for applications such as fast meta-atom/metasurface on-demand design and optimization.},

 abstract = {Metasurfaces are being widely investigated and adopted for their promising performances in manipulating optical wavefronts and their potential for integrating multi-functionalities into one flat optical device. A key challenge in metasurface design is the non-intuitive design process that produces models and patterns from specific design requirements (commonly electromagnetic responses). A complete exploration of all design spaces can produce optimal designs but is unrealistic considering the massive amount of computation power required to explore large parameter spaces. Meanwhile, machine learning techniques, especially generative adversarial networks, have proven to be an effective solution to non-intuitive design tasks. In this paper, we present a novel conditional generative network that can generate meta-atom/metasurface designs based on different performance requirements. Compared to conventional trial-and-error or iterative optimization design methods, this new methodology is capable of producing on-demand freeform designs on a one-time calculation basis. More importantly, an increased complexity of design goals doesn't introduce further complexity into the network structure or the training process, which makes this approach suitable for multi-functional device designs. Compared to previous deep learning-based metasurface approaches, our network structure is extremely robust to train and converge, and is readily expanded to many multi-functional metasurface devices, including metasurface filters, lenses and holograms.},

 abstract = {A novel microwave noninvasive planar sensor based on the complementary split ring resonator (CSRR) is proposed for an accurate measurement of the complex permittivity of materials. The CSRR is etched in the ground plane of the planar microstrip line. Two CSRRs of rectangular and circular cross-sections are chosen for the sensitivity analysis, where the later is found to possess higher sensitivity and hence appears to be more appropriate for the sensor design. At resonance, the electric field induced along the plane of CSRR is found to be quite sensitive for the characterization of specimen kept in contact with the sensor. A numerical model is developed here for the calculation of the complex permittivity as a function of resonant frequency and the quality factor data using the electromagnetic simulator, the Computer Simulation Technology. For practical applications, a detailed air gap analysis is carried out to consider the effect of any air gap present between the test sample and the CSRR. The designed sensor is fabricated and tested, and accordingly the numerically established relations are experimentally verified for various reference samples e.g., teflon, polyvinyl chloride, plexiglas, polyethylene, rubber, and wood. Experimentally, it is found that the permittivity measurement using the proposed sensor is possible with a typical error of 3\%.},

Here, we develop a method for designing optical systems composed of multiple unique metasurfaces aligned in sequence and separated by distances much larger than the design wavelengths. Our approach is based on computational inverse design, also known as the adjoint-gradient method. This technique enables thousands or millions of independent design variables (e.g., the shapes of individual meta-atoms) to be optimized in parallel, with little or no intervention required by the user. The assumptions underlying our method are as follows: we use the local periodic approximation to determine the phase-response of a given meta-atom, we use the scalar wave approximation to propagate light fields between metasurface layers, and we do not consider multiple reflections between metasurface layers (analogous to a sequential-optics ray-tracer). To demonstrate the broad applicability of our method, we use it to design an achromatic doublet metasurface lens, a spectrally-multiplexed holographic element, and an ultra-compact optical neural network for classifying handwritten digits.},

Due to multiple reflections that occur in case of a material slab with finite dimensions these coefficients also strongly depend on the materials thickness. This paper describes an approach to determine the electromagnetic properties of a material under test by applying an ellipsometric measurement without knowledge of the materials thickness. The paper shows that the additional measurement of the transmission coefficients allows to perform an exact measurement of the complex permittivity since the thickness dependencies in reflection and transmission coefficients are removed. The measurements are done in the frequency range from 22 GHz to 26 GHz by using a vector network analyzer setup with a conical horn antenna.},

 abstract = {Inverse design represents a paradigm shift in the development of nanophotonic devices, where optimal geometries and materials are discovered by an algorithm rather than symmetry considerations or intuition. Here we present a very general formulation of inverse design that is applicable to atomic interactions in external environments, and derive from this some explicit formulae for optimisation of spontaneous decay rates, Casimir-Polder forces and resonant energy transfer. Using the Q factor of the latter as an example, we use finite-difference time-domain techniques to demonstrate the ability of inverse design algorithms to go far beyond what can be achieved by intuition-based approaches, opening up a new route to their technological exploitation.},

 year = {2012},
 month = feb,
 publisher = {{JMLR.org}},
 abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimization. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a comparison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural networks and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising configuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent "High Throughput" methods achieve surprising success--they appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural baseline against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

 abstract = {Optimal design, optimal control, and parameter estimation of systems governed by partial differential equations (PDE) give rise to a class of problems known as PDE-constrained optimization. The size and complexity of the discretized PDEs often pose significant challenges for contemporary optimization methods. Recent advances in algorithms, software, and high performance computing systems have resulted in PDE simulations that can often scale to millions of variables, thousands of processors, and multiple physics interactions. As PDE solvers mature, there is increasing interest in industry and the national labs in solving optimization problems governed by such large-scale simulations. This article provides a brief introduction and overview to the Lecture Notes in Computational Science and Engineering volume entitled Large-Scale PDE-Constrained Optimization.This volume contains nineteen articles that were initially presented at the First Sandia Workshop on Large-Scale PDE-Constrained Optimization. The articles in this volume assess the state-of-the-art in PDE-constrained optimization, identify challenges to optimization presented by modern highly parallel PDE simulation codes and discuss promising algorithmic and software approaches to address them. These contributions represent current research of two strong scientific computing communities, in optimization and PDE simulation. This volume merges perspectives in these two different areas and identifies interesting open questions for further research. We hope that this volume leads to greater synergy and collaboration between these communities.},

A least-squares regression is used to estimate the shape of the local fitness landscape. From this shape, the expected location of the peak is calculated and the information given to the PSO. By guiding the PSO to the optimum, the local convergence speed can be vastly improved. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using regression on several static multimodal test functions as well as dynamicmultimodal test scenarios (Moving Peaks). This chapter also extends theMoving Peaks test suite by enhancing the standard conic peak function to allow the creation of asymmetrical and additional multiple local peaks. The combination of this technique and a speciation-based PSO compares favourably to another multi-swarm PSO algorithm that has proven to be working well on the Moving peaks test functions.},

Unlike other cloaking approaches, which are typically limited to subwavelength objects, the transformation method allows the design of cloaking devices that render a macroscopic object invisible. In addition, the design is not sensitive to the object that is being cloaked. The first experimental demonstration of such a cloak at microwave frequencies was recently reported. We note, however, that that design cannot be implemented for an optical cloak, which is certainly of particular interest because optical frequencies are where the word 'invisibility' is conventionally defined. Here we present the design of a non-magnetic cloak operating at optical frequencies. The principle and structure of the proposed cylindrical cloak are analysed, and the general recipe for the implementation of such a device is provided.},

The local search algorithm is applied to the scale factor in order to generate high quality solutions. Due to its structure, the computational cost of the local search is independent on the number of dimensions characterizing the problem and thus is a suitable component for large scale problems. The proposed algorithm has been compared with a standard DE and two other modern DE based metaheuristics for a varied set of test problems. Numerical results show that the DELS is an efficient and robust algorithm for highly multivariate optimization, and the employment of the local search to the scale factor is beneficial in order to detect solutions with a high quality, convergence speed and algorithmic robustness.},

First, FMNW metamaterials are placed in the historical context of antique composites and 20th Century artificial dielectrics, and presented as an example of second-generation metamaterials following the microstructured metamaterials developed in the first part of the decade. Next, the fabrication processes of FMNW metamaterials and subsequent planar devices are detailed. It is then shown how the geometrical properties of the FMNW structure, such as the wire diameter and the wire nanodisk thicknesses, determine the dc and RF responses of the material. Upon this basis, the modeling of the metamaterial is presented, using a two-level approach where the microscopic (with respect to the wires) susceptibility is derived by solving the Landau-Lifshitz equation and the macroscopic (metamaterial) permittivity and permeability tensors are obtained by effective medium theory. Next, a review of FMNW microwave devices, such as circulators, isolators, and phase shifters, is provided, and the example of an FMNW dual-band edge-mode isolator is studied. Finally, spintronic effects and applications of FMNW metamaterials, such as dc to RF generators and detectors based on the spin-torque transfer phenomenon, are reviewed.},

 abstract = {Acoustic metamaterials constructed by resonant microelements in subwavelength scale were generally characterized by the effective medium approximation theory, which neglects the interaction between adjacent elements. In this paper, we show that twisting the orientation of resonators in acoustic metamaterials produces secondary coupled resonant modes by introducing internal vibration interaction. Metamaterials composed of a single-slit Helmholtz resonator arranged in two-dimensional square lattice are investigated. We rotate a portion of the resonator so that the adjacent resonators in a {$\Gamma$}X direction have a twist angle of {$\varphi$}. For the system with {$\varphi$}=180{$\circ $}, the coupling interaction produces the symmetric coupled mode in in-phase oscillation and the antisymmetric coupled mode in out-of-phase oscillation. This acoustic analog of ``hybridization effect'' leads to a sharp transparency window in the extended locally-resonant forbidden gap, which is analogous to the phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency. Such coupled resonant modes may have potential applications in sound wave manipulations such as acoustic filtering and imaging.},

 abstract = {The evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are a family of nature-inspired algorithms widely used for solving complex optimization problems. Since the operators (e.g. crossover, mutation, selection) in most traditional EAs are developed on the basis of fixed heuristic rules or strategies, they are unable to learn the structures or properties of the problems to be optimized. To equip the EAs with learning abilities, recently, various model-based evolutionary algorithms (MBEAs) have been proposed. This survey briefly reviews some representative MBEAs by considering three different motivations of using models. First, the most commonly seen motivation of using models is to estimate the distribution of the candidate solutions. Second, in evolutionary multi-objective optimization, one motivation of using models is to build the inverse models from the objective space to the decision space. Third, when solving computationally expensive problems, models can be used as surrogates of the fitness functions. Based on the review, some further discussions are also given.},

 abstract = {Various electromagnetic (EM) structures become more complex and often have increasing degrees of design freedom. Classical optimization methods require numerous simulation trials of different parameter combinations, which leads to a low design efficiency. To address this problem, an efficient EM structure optimization algorithm which combines differential evolution (DE) with machine learning technology is proposed in this paper. By partly substituting electromagnetic (EM) solver, Kriging model predicts the responses and uncertainties of each individual after differential evolution. The exploration and exploitation of the searching can be adjusted by the constitution and prescreening of the population before and after evolution. This algorithm is applied to optimize the resonant frequencies of an E-shaped antenna with 6 variables. Comparing with the other optimization methods, the number of EM simulations needed is reduced by about 80\%.},

The system's ability to approach the MIMO capacity depends heavily on the designs of MIMO receiver and/or transmitter, which are generally expensive optimisation tasks. Hence, researchers and engineers have endeavoured to develop efficient optimisation techniques that can solve practical MIMO designs with affordable costs. In this contribution, we demonstrate that particle swarm optimisation (PSO) offers an efficient means for aiding MIMO transceiver designs. Specifically, we consider PSO-aided semi-blind joint maximum likelihood channel estimation and data detection for MIMO receiver, and we investigate PSO-based minimum bit-error-rate multiuser transmission for MIMO systems. In both these two MIMO applications, the PSO-aided approach attains an optimal design solution with a significantly lower complexity than the existing state-of-the-art scheme.},

 abstract = {The burgeoning research of graphene and other 2D materials enables many unprecedented metamaterials and metadevices for applications on nanophotonics. The design of on-demand graphene-based metamaterials often calls for the solution of a complex inverse problem within a small sampling space, which highly depends on the rich experiences from researchers of nanophotonics. Conventional optimization algorithms could be used for this inverse design, but they converge to local optimal solutions and take significant computational costs with increased nanostructure parameters. Here, we establish a deep learning method based on an adaptive batch-normalized neural network, aiming to implement smart and rapid inverse design for graphene-based metamaterials with on-demand optical responses. This method allows a quick converging speed with high precision and low computational consumption. As typical complex proof-of-concept examples, the optical metamaterials consisting of graphene/dielectric alternating multilayers are chosen to demonstrate the validity of our design paradigm. Our method demonstrates a high prediction accuracy of over 95\% after very few training epochs. A universal programming package is developed to achieve the design goals of graphene-based metamaterials with low absorption and near unity absorption, respectively. Our work may find important design applications in the field of nanoscale photonics based on graphene and other 2D materials.},

Foremost, the study demonstrates that the approach is robust towards the choice of initial guess provided for the optimization problem, in the sense that near identical final designs are obtained for vastly different initial guesses. This finding suggests that the final designs are near-optimal under the given design constraints. Secondarily, by stopping the design procedure after the same fixed number of design iterations for all initial guesses, it shows that the designed photonic cavity is sensitive towards certain small perturbations of their geometry, stressing the need for utilizing robust optimization techniques and imposing fabrication conforming length-scales in the cavity geometries.},

 abstract = {Multi-objective genetic Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy systems use multiobjective evolutionary algorithms to generate a set of fuzzy rule-based systems of the TS type with different trade-offs between, generally, complexity/interpretability and accuracy. The application of these algorithms requires a large number of TS system generations and evaluations.When we deal with high dimensional data sets, these tasks can be very time-consuming, thus making an adequate exploration of the search space very problematic. In this chapter, we propose two techniques to speed up generation and evaluation of TS systems. The first technique aims to speed up the identification of the consequent parameters of the TS rules, one of the most timeconsuming phases in TS generation. The application of this technique produces as a side-effect a decoupling of the rules in the TS system. Thus, modifications in a rule do not affect the other rules. Exploiting this property, the second technique proposes to store specific values used in the parents, so as to reuse them in the offspring and to avoid wasting time. We show the advantages of the proposed method in terms of computing time saving and improved search space exploration through two examples of multi-objective genetic learning of compact and accurate TS-type fuzzy systems for a high dimensional data set in the regression and time series forecasting domains.},

The rapid advance of hardware computing power and AD tools has enabled practitioners to quickly generate derivative-enhanced versions of their code for a broad range of applications in applied research and development. "Automatic Differentiation of Algorithms" provides a comprehensive and authoritative survey of all recent developments, new techniques, and tools for AD use. The book covers all aspects of the subject: mathematics, scientific programming ( i.e., use of adjoints in optimization) and implementation (i.e., memory management problems). A strong theme of the book is the relationships between AD tools and other software tools, such as compilers and parallelizers. A rich variety of significant applications are presented as well, including optimum-shape design problems, for which AD offers more efficient tools and techniques. Topics and features: * helpful introductory AD survey chapter for brief overview of the field *extensive applications chapters, i.e., for circuit simulation, optimization and optimal-control shape design, structural mechanics, and multibody dynamical systems modeling *comprehensive bibliography for all current literature and results for the field *performance issues *optimal control sensitivity analysis *AD use with object oriented software tool kits The book is an ideal and accessible survey of recent developments and applications of AD tools and techniques for a broad scientific computing and computer engineering readership. Practitioners, professionals, and advanced graduates working in AD development will find the book a useful reference and essential resource for their work.},

 abstract = {In many real world network problems several objectives have to be optimized simultaneously. To solve such problems, it is often appropriate to use the multi-criterion minimum spanning tree (MCMST) model, a combinatorial optimization problem that has been shown to be NP-Hard. In Pareto Optimization of the model no polynomial time algorithm is known to find the Pareto front for all instances of the MCMST problem. Researchers have therefore developed deterministic and evolutionary algorithms. However, these exhibit a number of shortcomings such as lack of scalability and large CPU times. Therefore, the hybridised Knowledge-based Evolutionary Algorithm (KEA) has been proposed, which does not have the limitations of previous algorithms because of its speed, its scalability to more than 500 nodes in the bi-criterion case and scalability to the multicriterion case, and its ability to find both the supported and non-supported optimal solutions. KEA is faster and more efficient than NSGA-II in terms of spread and number of solutions found. The only weakness of KEA is the dominated middle of its Pareto front. In order to overcome this deficiency, a number of modifications have been tested including KEA-M, KEA-G and KEA-W. Experimental results show that when time is expensive KEA is preferable to all other algorithms tested.},

Along with numerous successes, new challenges are inviting researchers to refocus the efforts and approaches that were originally inspired by the MGI. In May 2017, the National Science Foundation sponsored the workshop ``Advancing and Accelerating Materials Innovation Through the Synergistic Interaction among Computation, Experiment, and Theory: Opening New Frontiers'' to review accomplishments that emerged from investments in science and infrastructure under the MGI, identify scientific opportunities in this new environment, examine how to effectively utilize new materials innovation infrastructure, and discuss challenges in achieving accelerated materials research through the seamless integration of experiment, computation, and theory. This article summarizes key findings from the workshop and provides perspectives that aim to guide the direction of future materials research and its translation into societal impacts.},

 abstract = {A methodology based on topology optimization for the design of metamaterials with negative permeability is presented. The formulation is based on the design of a thin layer of copper printed on a dielectric, rectangular plate of fixed dimensions. An effective media theory is used to estimate the effective permeability, obtained after solving Maxwell's equations on a representative cell of a periodic arrangement using a full 3D finite element model. The effective permeability depends on the layout of copper, and the subject of the topology optimization problem is to find layouts that result in negative (real) permeability at a prescribed frequency. A SIMP-like model is invoked to represent the conductivity of regions of intermediate density. A number of different filtering strategies are invoked to facilitate convergence to binary solutions. Examples of designs for S-band applications are presented for illustration. New metamaterial concepts are uncovered, beyond the classical split-ring inspired layouts.},

 abstract = {Many problems formerly considered intractable have been satisfactorily resolved using approximate optimization methods called metaheuristics. These methods use a non-deterministic approach that finds good solutions, despite not ensuring the determination of the overall optimum. The success of a metaheuristic is conditioned on its capacity of alternating properly between the exploration and exploitation of solution spaces. During the process of searching for better solutions, a metaheuristic can be guided to regions of promising solutions using the acquisition of information on the problem under study. In this study this is done through the use of reinforcement learning. The performance of a metaheuristic can also be improved using multiple search trajectories, which act competitively and/or cooperatively. This can be accomplished using parallel processing. Thus, in this paper we propose a hybrid parallel implementation for the GRASP metaheuristics and the genetic al gorithm, using reinforcement learning, applied to the symmetric traveling salesman problem.},

In this paper, we consider a dielectric permittivity that is a N-pole Lorentz function of the pulsation \$\omega\$. We propose a common formalism and obtain different formulas for the modal expansion. The non-uniqueness of the excitation coeffcient is due to a choice of the linearization of Maxwell's equation with respect to \$\omega\$ and of the form of the source term. We make the link between the numerical discrete modal expansion and analytical formulas that can be found in the literature. We detail the formulation of dispersive Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) in order to keep a linear eigenvalue problem. We also give an algorithm to regain an orthogonal basis for degenerate modes. Numerical results validate the different formulas and compare their accuracy.},

For SRRs on doped GaAs films, incident terahertz radiation with peak fields of {$\sim$}20--160 kV/cm drives intervalley scattering. This reduces the carrier mobility and enhances the SRR LC response due to a conductivity decrease in the doped thin film. Above {$\sim$}160 kV/cm, electric field enhancement within the SRR gaps leads to efficient impact ionization, increasing the carrier density and the conductivity which, in turn, suppresses the SRR resonance. We demonstrate an increase of up to 10 orders of magnitude in the carrier density in the SRR gaps on semi-insulating GaAs. Furthermore, we show that the effective permittivity can be swept from negative to positive values with an increasing terahertz field strength in the impact ionization regime, enabling new possibilities for nonlinear metamaterials.},

 abstract = {The properties of ferroelectric devices are strongly influenced, besides crystallographic features, by defects in the material. To study this effect, a fully coupled electromechanical phase-field model for 2D ferroelectric volume elements has been developed and implemented in a Finite Element code. Different kinds of defects were considered: holes, point charges and polarization pinning in single crystals, as well as grain boundaries in polycrystals, without and with additional dielectric interphase. The impact of the various types of defects on the domain configuration and the overall coercive field strength is discussed in detail. It can be seen that defects lead to nucleation of new domains. Compared to the energy barrier for switching in an ideal single crystal, the overall coercive field strength is significantly reduced towards realistic values as they are found in ferroelectric devices. Also the simulated hysteresis loops show a more realistic shape in the presence of defects.},

 abstract = {We show that deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) can massively outperform traditional densely-connected neural networks (both deep or shallow) in predicting eigenvalue problems in mechanics. In this sense, we strike out in a new direction in mechanics computations with strongly predictive NNs whose success depends not only on architectures being deep, but also being fundamentally different from the widely-used to date. We consider a model problem: predicting the eigenvalues of 1-D and 2-D phononic crystals. For the 1-D case, the optimal CNN architecture reaches 98\% accuracy level on unseen data when trained with just 20,000 samples, compared to 85\% accuracy even with 100, 000 samples for the typical network of choice in mechanics research. We show that, with relatively high data-efficiency, CNNs have the capability to generalize well and automatically learn deep symmetry operations, easily extending to higher dimensions and our 2D case. Most importantly, we show how CNNs can naturally represent mechanical material tensors, with its convolution kernels serving as local receptive fields, which is a natural representation of mechanical response. Strategies proposed are applicable to other mechanics' problems and may, in the future, be used to sidestep cumbersome algorithms with purely data-driven approaches based upon modern deep architectures.},

The framework uses similarity-based surrogate models and an individual-based model management with pre-selection. Instead of existing frameworks where the surrogates are used to improve the performance of evolutionary operators or as local search tools, here we use them to allow for an augmented number of generations to evolve solutions. The introduction of the surrogates into the evolutionary cycle is controlled by a single parameter, which is related with the number of generations performed by the evolutionary algorithm.Numerical experiments are conducted in order to assess the applicability and the performance in constrained and unconstrained, single- and multi-objective optimization problems. The results show that the present framework arises as an attractive alternative to improve the final solutions with a fixed budget of expensive evaluations.},

Particular attention is paid to periodic textures occurring in incommensurate phases and the transformation of these textures into domains in lock-in phases.

The machinery of genetic algorithms utilizes an optimization methodology that allows a global search of the cost surface via statistical random processes dictated by the Darwinian evolutionary concept. These easily programmed and readily implemented procedures robustly locate extrema of highly multimodal functions and therefore are particularly well suited to finding solutions to a broad range of electromagnetic optimization problems. Electromagnetic Optimization by Genetic Algorithms is the first book devoted exclusively to the application of genetic algorithms to electromagnetic device design. Compiled by two highly competent and well-respected members of the electromagnetics community, this book describes numerous applications of genetic algorithms to the design and optimization of various low- and high-frequency electromagnetic components. Special features include:*Introduction by David E. Goldberg, "A Meditation on the Application of Genetic Algorithms"*Design of linear and planar arrays using genetic algorithms*Application of genetic algorithms to the design of broadband, wire, and integrated antennas*Genetic algorithm---driven design of dielectric gratings and frequency-selective surfaces*Synthesis of magnetostatic devices using genetic algorithms*Application of genetic algorithms to multiobjective electromagnetic backscattering optimization*A comprehensive list of the up-to-date references applicable to electromagneticdesign problemsSupplemented with more than 250 illustrations, Electromagnetic Optimization by Genetic Algorithms is a powerful resource for electrical engineers interested in modern electromagnetic designs and an indispensable reference for university researchers.},

To this end, we first analytically determine the quasi-static response of a wide class of composites to an electric field along the fibers. We then formulate and calculate incremental motions of general polarization propagating in the deformed composite, using a plane wave expansion approach. We numerically explore the dependency of the motion on the composite properties and electric field. We show how complete band gaps are tuned by adjusting the electric field, owing to resultant geometrical and physical changes. These results suggest that soft dielectrics can serve as tunable waveguides and filters.},

 abstract = {This chapter is concerned with the efficient use of metamodel-assisted evolutionary algorithms built in multilevel or hierarchical schemes for the solution of computationally expensive optimization problems. Existing methods developed by other researchers or the authors' group are overviewed and a new enhancement based on fitness inheritance is proposed. Whereas conventional evolutionary algorithms require a great number of calls to the evaluation software, the use of low cost surrogates or metamodels, trained on the fly on previously evaluated individuals for pre-evaluating the evolving populations, reduce noticeably the CPU cost of an optimization. Since, themetamodel training requires a minimum amount of previous evaluations, the starting population is evaluated on the problem-specific model. Fitness inheritance is introduced in this context so as to approximate the objective function values in place of metamodels. In addition, to profit of the availability of evaluation or parameterization models of lower fidelity and CPU cost and/or refinement methods, a multilevel search algorithm relying also on the use of metamodels is presented. The algorithm may optionally operate as hierarchical-distributed (many levels performing distributed optimization) or distributed-hierarchical (more than one sub-populations undergoing their own hierarchical optimizations) to further reduce the design cycle time. The proposed algorithms are generic and can be used to solve any kind of optimization problems. Here, aerodynamic shape optimization problems, including turbomachinery applications, are used to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods. A new computationally demanding application, namely the optimization of a 3D compressor blade is also shown.},

 abstract = {The optimization of expensive-to-evaluate functions generally relies on metamodel-based exploration strategies. Many deterministic global optimization algorithms used in the field of computer experiments are based on Kriging (Gaussian process regression). Starting with a spatial predictor including a measure of uncertainty, they proceed by iteratively choosing the point maximizing a criterion which is a compromise between predicted performance and uncertainty. Distributing the evaluation of such numerically expensive objective functions on many processors is an appealing idea. Here we investigate a multi-points optimization criterion, the multipoints expected improvement (\(q-\{\mathbb E\}I\)), aimed at choosing several points at the same time. An analytical expression of the \(q-\{\mathbb E\}I\) is given when q = 2, and a consistent statistical estimate is given for the general case. We then propose two classes of heuristic strategies meant to approximately optimize the \(q-\{\mathbb E\}I\), and apply them to the classical Branin-Hoo test-case function. It is finally demonstrated within the covered example that the latter strategies perform as good as the best Latin Hypercubes and Uniform Designs ever found by simulation (2000 designs drawn at random for every q {$\in $} [1,10]).},

 abstract = {Automatic image registration is a fundamental task in medical image processing, and significant advances have occurred in the last decade. However, one major problem with advanced registration techniques is their high computational cost. Due to this restraint, these methods have found limited application to clinical situations where real time or near real time execution is required, e.g., intraoperative imaging, or high volumes of data need to be processed periodically. High performance in image registration can be achieved by reduction in data and search spaces. However, to obtain a significant increase in performance, these approaches must be complemented with parallel processing. Parallel processing is associated with expensive supercomputers and computer clusters that are unaffordable for most public medical institutions. This chapter will describe how to take advantage of an existing computational infrastructure and achieve high performance image registration in a practical and affordable way. More specifically, it will outline the implementation of a fast and robust Internet subtraction service, using a distributed evolutionary algorithm and a service-oriented architecture.},

 abstract = {This chapter discusses the treatment of expensive optimization problems in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) problems by combining two strategies. First, we perform the whole optimization varying the accuracy with which a given candidate solution is evaluated by the expensive black-box function, rather than using the same accuracy for all evaluations. This idea follows from the fact that evolutionary algorithms, in general, employ more searching effort on the most promising regions of the search domain.We can adopt the same principles for allocating more computational effort when evaluating candidate solutions within these regions. The second strategy is the employment of local approximations within the local search operator of memetic algorithms. Since the points in the data are evaluated with different accuracies, the approximation methodology should give greater weight to samples evaluated with higher precision. The chapter proceeds to the formal analysis of approximation-based memetic algorithms, in which we investigate the effect of the local search operators on the global convergence properties of evolutionary algorithms viaMarkov chain theory, and also study the computational complexity of the approximation-based local search operator. The chapter concludeswith the illustration of the methodology in the design of electromagnetic devices, as an example of an expensive optimization problem.},

We explain how to incorporate the momentum balance and constitutive relations into PINN, and explore in detail the application to linear elasticity, although the framework is rather general and can be extended to other solid-mechanics problems. While common PINN algorithms are based on training one deep neural network (DNN), we propose a multi-network model that results in more accurate representation of the field variables. To validate the model, we test the framework on synthetic data generated from analytical and numerical reference solutions. We study convergence of the PINN model, and show that Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) results in superior accuracy and convergence characteristics compared with classic low-order Finite Element Method (FEM). We also show the applicability of the framework for transfer learning, and find vastly accelerated convergence during network re-training. Finally, we find that honoring the physics leads to improved robustness: when trained only on a few parameters, we find that the PINN model can accurately predict the solution for a wide range of parameters new to the network---thus pointing to an important application of this framework to sensitivity analysis and surrogate modeling.},

Our approach includes the additive combination of a reversible and an irreversible portion of the polarization and strain, respectively. Whereas the reversible parts correspond to the common piezoelectric linear equations, the irreversible parts are modeled by hysteresis operators. These operators are based on Preisach and Jiles-Atherton hysteresis models which are well-established tools in ferromagnetic modeling. In contrast to micro-mechanical approaches, a Preisach or a Jiles-Atherton hysteresis operator can be efficiently numerically evaluated.

 abstract = {This paper presents a bidirectional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) method for designing periodic microstructures of two-phase composites with extremal electromagnetic permeability and permittivity. The effective permeability and effective permittivity of the composite are obtained by applying the homogenization technique to the representative periodic base cell (PBC). Single or multiple objectives are defined to maximize or minimize the electromagnetic properties separately or simultaneously. The sensitivity analysis of the objective function is conducted using the adjoint method. Based on the established sensitivity number, BESO gradually evolves the topology of the PBC to an optimum. Numerical examples demonstrate that the electromagnetic properties of the resulting 2D and 3D microstructures are very close to the theoretical Hashin-Shtrikman (HS) bounds. The proposed BESO algorithm is computationally efficient as the solution usually converges in less than 50 iterations. The proposed BESO method can be implemented easily as a post-processor to standard commercial finite element analysis software packages, e.g. ANSYS which has been used in this study. The resulting topologies are clear black-and-white solutions (with no grey areas). Some interesting topological patterns such as Vigdergauz-type structure and Schwarz primitive structure have been found which will be useful for the design of electromagnetic materials.},

This mapping indicates that physical wave systems can be trained to learn complex features in temporal data, using standard training techniques for neural networks. As a demonstration, we show that an inverse-designed inhomogeneous medium can perform vowel classification on raw audio signals as their waveforms scatter and propagate through it, achieving performance comparable to a standard digital implementation of a recurrent neural network.

 abstract = {The capacitor is a key element of electronic devices and is characterized by positive capacitance. However, a negative capacitance (NC) behaviour may occur in certain cases and implies a local voltage drop opposed to the overall applied bias. Therefore, a local NC response results in voltage enhancement across the rest of the circuit. Within a suitably designed heterostructure, ferroelectrics display such an NC effect, and various ferroelectricbased microelectronic and nanoelectronic devices have been developed, showing improved performance attributed to NC. However, the exact physical nature of the NC response and direct experimental evidence remain elusive or controversial thus far. In this Review1mu, we discuss the physical mechanisms responsible for ferroelectric NC, tackling static and transient NC responses. We examine ferroelectric responses to voltage and charge, as well as ferroelectric switching, and discuss proof-of-concept experiments and possibilities for device implementation. Finally1mu, we highlight different approaches for the optimization of the intrinsic NC response to maximize voltage amplification.},

 abstract = {Here, the domain switching in a ferroelectric and ferroelastic single crystal subjected to electrical, electromechanical, and mechanical loading condition is studied. An isoparametric 3D electromechanical hexahedral finite element introducing the micromechanical constitutive law for domain switching is proposed to investigate the non-linear response of single crystal piezoceramics. The micromechanical model considered here is based on thermodynamic approach and internal variables, accounting for the electromechanical interaction energy between the domains. The volume fractions of six distinct uni-axial variants are treated as the internal variables to describe the microscopic state of the material at any given loading level. Furthermore, the formulation includes a realistic phase transition from a cubic unit cell to tetragonal one in the single crystal piezoceramics under the application of external load. The non-linear electromechanical constitutive equations obtained are solved using an implicit integration technique employing the return-mapping algorithm. The model developed here is tested for its applicability considering variety of benchmarks, and it brings out the behaviour of piezoceramic materials as observed in experimental studies.The hexahedral finite element presented is also implemented in the commercial finite element code Abaqus via the User Element subroutine.},

Training is performed by calculating the forward and adjoint electromagnetic simulations of outputted devices and using the subsequent efficiency gradients for backpropagation. With metagratings operating across a range of wavelengths and angles as a model system, we show that devices produced from the trained generative network have efficiencies comparable to or better than the best devices produced by adjoint-based topology optimization, while requiring less computational cost. Our reframing of adjoint-based optimization to the training of a generative neural network applies generally to physical systems that can utilize gradients to improve performance.},

The recently developed metamaterials provide efficient approaches to generate a perfect optical illusion. However, all existing research on metamaterial illusions has been limited to theory and numerical simulations. Here, we propose the concept of a radar illusion, which can make the electromagnetic (EM) image of a target gathered by radar look like a different target, and we realize a radar illusion device experimentally to change the radar image of a metallic target into a dielectric target with predesigned size and material parameters. It is well known that the radar signatures of metallic and dielectric objects are significantly different. However, when a metallic target is enclosed by the proposed illusion device, its EM scattering characteristics will be identical to that of a predesigned dielectric object under the illumination of radar waves. Such an illusion device will confuse the radar, and hence the real EM properties of the metallic target cannot be perceived. We designed and fabricated the radar illusion device using artificial metamaterials in the microwave frequency, and good illusion performances are observed in the experimental results.},

The inverse design of these devices is a non-convex optimization problem in a high dimensional space, making global optimization a major challenge. We present a new type of population-based global optimization algorithm for metasurfaces that is enabled by the training of a generative neural network. The loss function used for backpropagation depends on the generated pattern layouts, their efficiencies, and efficiency gradients, which are calculated by the adjoint variables method using forward and adjoint electromagnetic simulations. We observe that the distribution of devices generated by the network continuously shifts towards high performance design space regions over the course of optimization. Upon training completion, the best generated devices have efficiencies comparable to or exceeding the best devices designed using standard topology optimization. Our proposed global optimization algorithm can generally apply to other gradient-based optimization problems in optics, mechanics, and electronics.},

 abstract = {It was mainly during the last two decades that the theory of homogenization or averaging of partial differential equations took shape as a distinct mathe\- matical discipline. This theory has a lot of important applications in mechanics of composite and perforated materials, filtration, disperse media, and in many other branches of physics, mechanics and modern technology. There is a vast literature on the subject. The term averaging has been usually associated with the methods of non\- linear mechanics and ordinary differential equations developed in the works of Poincare, Van Der Pol, Krylov, Bogoliubov, etc. For a long time, after the works of Maxwell and Rayleigh, homogeniza\- tion problems for{$\cdot$} partial differential equations were being mostly considered by specialists in physics and mechanics, and were staying beyond the scope of mathematicians. A great deal of attention was given to the so called disperse media, which, in the simplest case, are two-phase media formed by the main homogeneous material containing small foreign particles (grains, inclusions). Such two-phase bodies, whose size is considerably larger than that of each sep\- arate inclusion, have been discovered to possess stable physical properties (such as heat transfer, electric conductivity, etc.) which differ from those of the con\- stituent phases. For this reason, the word homogenized, or effective, is used in relation to these characteristics. An enormous number of results, approximation formulas, and estimates have been obtained in connection with such problems as electromagnetic wave scattering on small particles, effective heat transfer in two-phase media, etc.},

Therefore, time-efficient approximate models can be particularly beneficial for the evaluation when evolutionary algorithms are applied. In this paper, the convergence property of an evolution strategy (ES) with neural network based fitness evaluations is investigated. It is found that the evolutionary algorithm will converge incorrectly if the approximate model has false optima. To address this problem, two strategies to control the evolution process are introduced. In addition, methods to eliminate false minima in neural network training are proposed. The effectiveness of the methods are shown with simulation studies on the Ackley function and the Rosenbrock function.},

 abstract = {Toroidal multipoles are fundamental electromagnetic excitations different from those associated with the familiar charge and magnetic multipoles. They have been held responsible for parity violation in nuclear and particle physics, but direct evidence of their existence in classical electrodynamics has remained elusive. We report on the observation of a resonant electromagnetic response in an artificially engineered medium, or metamaterial, that cannot be attributed to magnetic or charge multipoles and can only be explained by the existence of a toroidal dipole. Our direct experimental evidence of the toroidal response brings attention to the often ignored electromagnetic interactions involving toroidal multipoles, which could be present in naturally occurring systems, especially at the macromolecule level, where toroidal symmetry is ubiquitous. A material that embeds metal wire loops in a dielectric has properties consistent with an exotic electromagnetic excitation.

 abstract = {Our objective is the construction of a phenomenological model of ferroelectricity for general electro-mechanical loading histories, which is simple enough to be implemented in an FE-code with realistic effort. In this paper we motivate and verify the one-dimensional formulation of such a model. It relies upon introducing the remanent polarization and the remanent strain as internal variables besides stress, strain, electric field and polarization. The internal variables are governed by ordinary differential equations. Each of these evolution equations is subjected to two loading conditions of different nature. The first one indicates the onset of changes of the remanent quantities by domain switching, while the second one characterizes the saturation value of a remanent quantity corresponding to a totally switched domain structure. Polarization induced anisotropy is taken into account as far as it seemed necessary. For simplicity, no rate effects are included. The model response to uniaxial electro-mechanical loading histories will be discussed in comparison to known experimental results. By means of a bilinear approximation the following characteristic phenomena of macroscopic ferroelectricity are represented : dielectric hysteresis, polarization induced piezoelectricity, butterfly hysteresis, ferroelastic hysteresis, mechanical depolarization.},

A unique class of flat optical components with high functionality can be designed by introducing abrupt phase shifts into the optical path, utilizing the resonant response of arrays of scatterers with deeply subwavelength thickness. As an application of this concept, we report a theoretical and experimental study of birefringent arrays of two-dimensional (V- and Y-shaped) optical antennas which support two orthogonal charge-oscillation modes and serve as broadband, anisotropic optical elements that can be used to locally tailor the amplitude, phase, and polarization of light. The degree of optical anisotropy can be designed by controlling the interference between the waves scattered by the antenna modes; in particular, we observe a striking effect in which the anisotropy disappears as a result of destructive interference. These properties are captured by a simple, physical model in which the antenna modes are treated as independent, orthogonally oriented harmonic oscillators.},

The scalar function is then regularized by a PDE based filter. Several image-processing based filtering techniques have so far been proposed for regularization or restricting the minimum length scale. They are conventionally applied to the design sensitivities rather than the design variables themselves. However, it causes discrepancies between the filtered sensitivities and the actual sensitivities that may confuse the optimization process and disturb the convergence. In this paper, we propose a Heaviside projection based topology optimization method with a scalar function that is filtered by a Helmholtz type partial differential equation. Therefore, the optimality can be strictly discussed in terms of the KKT condition. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a minimum compliance problem is solved.},

 abstract = {Design of efficient thin film photovoltaic (PV) cells require optical power absorption to be computed inside a nano-scale structure of photovoltaics, dielectric and plasmonic materials. Calculating power absorption requires Maxwell's electromagnetic equations which are solved using numerical methods, such as finite difference time domain (FDTD). The computational cost of thin film PV cell design and optimization is therefore cumbersome, due to successive FDTD simulations. This cost can be reduced using a surrogate-based optimization procedure. In this study, we deploy neural networks (NNs) to model optical absorption in organic PV structures. We use the corresponding surrogate-based optimization procedure to maximize light trapping inside thin film organic cells infused with metallic particles. Metallic particles are known to induce plasmonic effects at the metal--semiconductor interface, thus increasing absorption. However, a rigorous design procedure is required to achieve the best performance within known design guidelines. As a result of using NNs to model thin film solar absorption, the required time to complete optimization is decreased by more than five times. The obtained NN model is found to be very reliable. The optimization procedure results in absorption enhancement greater than 200\%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that once a reliable surrogate model such as the developed NN is available, it can be used for alternative analyses on the proposed design, such as uncertainty analysis (e.g., fabrication error).},

 abstract = {Herein, a new approach for using the intelligence aspects of artificial intelligence for knowledge discovery rather than device optimization in electromagnetic (EM) nanostructures is presented. This approach uses training data obtained through full-wave EM simulations of a series of nanostructures to train geometric deep learning algorithms to assess the range of feasible responses as well as the feasibility of a desired response from a class of EM nanostructures. To facilitate the knowledge discovery, this approach combines the dimensionality reduction technique with convex-hull and one-class support-vector-machine (SVM) algorithms to find the range of the feasible responses in the latent response space of the EM nanostructure. More importantly, the one-class SVM algorithm can be trained to provide the degree of feasibility of a response from a given nanostructure. This important information can be used to modify the initial structure to an alternative one that can enable an initially unfeasible response. To show the applicability of this approach, it is applied to two important classes of binary metasurfaces (MSs), formed by an array of plasmonic nanostructures, and periodic MSs formed by an array of dielectric nanopillars. These theoretical and experimental results confirm the unique features of this approach for knowledge discovery in EM nanostructures.},

 abstract = {We have fabricated vertically aligned ferroelectric PVDF mesoscale rod arrays comprising {$\beta$} and {$\gamma$} phases using a 200 nm diameter anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) as the porous template. We could synthesize the ferroelectric phase in mesoscale rod forms by combining the well-established recipe for crystallizing the {$\beta$} phase using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at low temperature and template-guided infiltration processing for the rods using AAO. We measured the dimensions of the PVDF rods by scanning electron microscopy and identified the polymorph phases by X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The length of the rods varied from 3.82 {$\mu$}m to 1.09 {$\mu$}m and the diameter from 232 nm to 287 nm when the volume ratio between DMSO and acetone changed from 5 : 5 to 10 : 0. We obtained well-defined piezoresponse hysteresis loops for all rods with remnant piezoresponse ranging from 2.12 pm/V to 5.04 pm/V and coercive voltage ranging from 2.29 V to 2.71 V using piezoresponse force microscopy. Our results serve as a processing platform for flexible electronic devices that need high capacitance and piezoelectric functionalities such as flexible memory devices or body energy harvesting devices for intelligent systems. 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

 abstract = {We study the mode conversion and resonant absorption phenomena occurring in a slab of a stratified anisotropic medium, optical axes of which are tilted with respect to the direction of inhomogeneity, using the invariant imbedding theory of wave propagation. When the tilt angle is zero, mode conversion occurs if the longitudinal component of the permittivity tensor, which is the one in the direction of inhomogeneity in the non-tilted case, varies from positive to negative values within the medium, while the transverse component plays no role. When the tilt angle is nonzero, the wave transmission and absorption show an asymmetry under the sign change of the incident angle in a range of the tilt angle, while the reflection is always symmetric. We calculate the reflectance, the transmittance and the absorptance for several configurations of the permittivity tensor and find that resonant absorption is greatly enhanced when the medium from the incident surface to the resonance region is hyperbolic than when it is elliptic. For certain configurations, the transmittance and absorptance curves display sharp peaks at some incident angles determined by the tilt angle.},

Our approach is based on response surface approximation (RSA) modeling and variable-fidelity electromagnetic (EM) simulations. In the design process, a computationally cheap RSA surrogate model constructed from sampled coarse-discretization EM antenna simulations is optimized using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. The initially determined Pareto optimal set representing the best possible trade-offs between conflicting design objectives is then iteratively refined. In each iteration, a limited number of high-fidelity EM model responses are incorporated into the RSA model using co-kriging. The enhanced RSA model is subsequently re-optimized to yield the refined Pareto set. Combination of low- and high-fidelity simulations as well as co-kriging results in the low overall optimization cost. The proposed approach is validated using two UWB antenna examples.},

 abstract = {The growing complexity of engineering modeling and design problems demands effective strategies for optimization of computationally expensive objective functions. To this end, we focus on knowledge-based, variable-fidelity optimization of expensive functions through a tried and tested, yet still rapidly evolving art called space mapping optimization. Fitting into the arena of surrogatebased optimization, space-mapping optimization is a model-driven optimization process where the model is an iteratively updated surrogate derived from a valid, low-fidelity or physics-based coarse model. Space mapping takes several forms. Here, we present and formulate the original input space mapping concept, as well as the more recent implicit and output space mapping concepts. Corresponding surrogate models are presented, classified, and discussed. A proposed optimization flow is explained. Then we illustrate both input space mapping and implicit space mapping through the space mapping optimization of a simple, technology-free wedgecutting problem. We also present tuning space mapping, a powerful methodology, but one that requires extra engineering knowledge of the problem under investigation. To confirm our work, we select representative examples from the fields of microwave and antenna engineering, including filter and antenna designs.},

In phase field models diffuse interfaces separate polarization domains as domain walls. Finite elements describe such interfaces with continuous field variables. But high gradients appear in the field variable requiring corresponding interpolations in the vicinity of domain walls. Otherwise, moving interfaces between phases stick to artificial minimum energy states, known as mesh-pinning. For this purpose, we study a selective enhancement of standard finite elements to avoid mesh-pinning effects. Our method enhances the ansatz space locally without impact on the physical theory or the overall finite element formulation.},

 abstract = {The aim of this paper is to apply a Helmholtz-type partial differential equation as an alternative to standard density filtering in topology optimization problems. Previously, this approach has been successfully applied as a sensitivity filter. The usual filtering techniques in topology optimization require information about the neighbor cells, which is difficult to obtain for fine meshes or complex domains and geometries. The complexity of the problem increases further in parallel computing, when the design domain is decomposed into multiple non-overlapping partitions. Obtaining information from the neighbor subdomains is an expensive operation. The proposed filter technique requires only mesh information necessary for the finite element discretization of the problem. The main idea is to define the filtered variable implicitly as a solution of a Helmholtz-type differential equation with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The properties of the filter are demonstrated for various 2D and 3D topology optimization problems in linear elasticity, solved on serial and parallel computers.

We implemented the cloak using an array of silicon nanorods fabricated by electron-beam lithography. We then directly visualized the cloaking effect by monitoring the light propagation inside the device using the near-field optical microscopy.},

 abstract = {This paper puts forth homogenization solutions for the macroscopic elastic dielectric response---under finite deformations and finite electric fields---of ideal elastic dielectric composites with two-phase isotropic particulate microstructures. Specifically, solutions are presented for three classes of microstructures: (i) an isotropic iterative microstructure wherein the particles are infinitely polydisperse in size, (ii) an isotropic distribution of polydisperse spherical particles of a finite number of different sizes, and (iii) an isotropic distribution of monodisperse spherical particles. The solution for the iterative microstructure, which corresponds to the viscosity solution of a Hamilton--Jacobi equation in five ``space'' variables, is constructed by means of a novel high-order WENO finite-difference scheme. On the other hand, the solutions for the microstructures with spherical particles are constructed by means of hybrid finite elements. Prompted by the functional features shared by all three obtained solutions, a simple closed-form approximation is proposed for the macroscopic elastic dielectric response of ideal elastic dielectric composites with any type of (non-percolative) isotropic particulate microstructure. As elaborated in a companion paper, the proposed approximate solution proves particularly useful as a fundamental building block to generate approximate solutions for the macroscopic elastic dielectric response of dielectric elastomer composites made up of non-Gaussian dielectric elastomers filled with nonlinear elastic dielectric particles.},

 abstract = {Transformation Optics has been proven a versatile technique for designing novel electromagnetic devices and it has much wider applicability in many subject areas related to general wave equations. Among them, quasi-conformal transformation optics (QCTO) can be applied to minimize anisotropy of transformed media and has opened up the possibility to the design of broadband antennas with arbitrary geometries. In this work, a wide-angle scanning conformal phased array based on all-dielectric QCTO lens is designed and experimentally demonstrated. Excited by the same current distribution as such in a conventional planar array, the conformal system in presence of QCTO lens can preserve the same radiation characteristics of a planar array with wide-angle beam-scanning and low side lobe level (SLL). Laplace's equation subject to Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions is adopted to construct the mapping between the virtual and physical spaces. The isotropic lens with graded refractive index is realized by all-dielectric holey structure after an effective parameter approximation. The measurements of the fabricated system agree well with the simulated results, which demonstrate its excellent wide-angle beam scanning performance. Such demonstration paves the way to a robust but efficient array synthesis, as well as multi-beam and beam forming realization of conformal arrays via transformation optics.},

 abstract = {A new parametric method for the design of Voronoi-based lattice porous structures is proposed in this paper. First, the functional relationship between the porosity p, the number of seed points n, and the beam radius r is established. The design space is then divided into individual unit cells, and the seed points and beam radius values of each unit cell are calculated. In each unit cell, Voronoi tessellation is used to generate uniformly distributed seed points. Finally in the design space, all seed points are Voronoi tessellated globally, and the edges are cylindered with corresponding beam radius values. With this design method, not only can the lattice structures with uniform or graded distribution of porosity be generated, but the customized lattice structures can also be generated according to the porosity of each unit cell. Through the analysis of model data, it is verified that the uniform distribution of seed points in this paper is stable and the porosity of the model is consistent with the design value. The distribution of pore spheres between pores is used to illustrate that the lattice porous structures designed in this paper is globally controllable and locally uniform.},

Here, we focus on the physics of a medium with finite dimensions consisting on a square lattice of parallel conducting wires arranged on a sub-wavelength scale. This medium supports electromagnetic fields that vary much faster than the operating wavelength. We show that such modes are dispersive due to the finiteness of the medium. Their dispersion relation is established in a simple way, a link with designer plasmons is made, and the canalization phenomenon is reinterpreted at the light of our model. We explain how to take advantage of this dispersion in order to code sub-wavelength wave fields in time. Finally, we show that the resonant nature of the medium ensures an efficient coupling of these modes with free space propagating waves and, thanks to the Purcell effect, with a source placed in the near field of the medium.},

The device creates the illusion that light propagates through empty flat space, whereas in physical space, light is bent around a hidden interior or seems to run backward in space or time. All of the previous proposals for invisibility require materials with extreme properties. Here we show that transformation optics of a curved, non-Euclidean space (such as the surface of a virtual sphere) relax these requirements and can lead to invisibility in a broad band of the spectrum. In theory, materials with a negative refractive index deployed in a curved, non-Euclidean space can provide a route to cloaking and invisibility across a range of wavelengths.

Twenty finite element models are constructed for each type of honeycomb samples (specimens) to obtain the mean values and standard deviations of the effective elastic properties. Spatially periodic boundary conditions are applied to each specimen containing 360 complete cells. The simulation results indicate that the elastic moduli increase as cell shapes become more irregular, but decrease as cell wall thickness gets less uniform. The Poisson's ratios are insignificantly affected by the presence of these two types of imperfections. The effect of the interaction between the co-existing cell shape and cell wall thickness imperfections on the elastic moduli is found to be weak. Bending remains as the dominant deformation mechanism in a loaded honeycomb having irregular cell shapes and/or non-uniform cell wall thickness. In addition, it is revealed that such imperfect honeycombs can be regarded as isotropic.},

Elastic solutions are derived for both elastically anisotropic and isotropic thin films with arbitrary domain structures, subject to the mixed stress-free and constraint boundary conditions. These solutions are employed in a three-dimensional phase-field model to investigate simultaneously the effect of substrate constraint and temperature on the volume fractions of domain variants, domain-wall orientations, surface topology, domain shapes, and their temporal evolution for a cubic-to-tetragonal ferroelectric phase transition. A specific example of a [001] orientated film heteroepitaxially grown on a [001] cubic substrate is considered. It is shown that the shapes of a-domains with tetragonal axes parallel to the film surface are significantly different from those of c-domains with tetragonal axes perpendicular to the film surface. For the substrate constraints and temperatures under which both a- and c-domains coexist, both types of a-domains are present with their tetragonal axes perpendicular to each other, and the domain wall orientations deviate from the 45 orientation generally assumed in thermodynamic analyses. It is demonstrated that a substrate constraint results in sequential nucleation and growth of different tetragonal domains during a ferroelectric phase transition.},

In this way, we can computationally discover completely unexpected metasurface designs for challenging multi-frequency, multi-angle problems, including designs for fully coupled multi-layer structures with arbitrary per-layer patterns. Unlike typical metasurface designs based on subwavelength unit cells, our approach can discover both sub- and supra-wavelength patterns and can obtain both the near and far fields.},

An example of 2D cloak with irregular cross section is designed and studied by full-wave simulations. The Huygens' Principle is applied to quantitatively evaluate its unusual electromagnetic behaviors. All the theoretical and numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The design of a cloak uses transformation optics, in which a conformal coordinate transformation is applied to Maxwell's equations to obtain a spatially distributed set of constitutive parameters that define the cloak. Here, we present an experimental realization of a cloak design that conceals a perturbation on a flat conducting plane, under which an object can be hidden. To match the complex spatial distribution of the required constitutive parameters, we constructed a metamaterial consisting of thousands of elements, the geometry of each element determined by an automated design process. The ground-plane cloak can be realized with the use of nonresonant metamaterial elements, resulting in a structure having a broad operational bandwidth (covering the range of 13 to 16 gigahertz in our experiment) and exhibiting extremely low loss. Our experimental results indicate that this type of cloak should scale well toward optical wavelengths.},

 abstract = {In recent years, various methods from the evolutionary computation (EC) field have been applied to electromagnetic (EM) design problems and have shown promising results. However, due to the high computational cost of the EM simulations, the efficiency of directly using evolutionary algorithms is often very low (e.g., several weeks' optimization time), which limits the application of these methods for many industrial applications. To address this problem, a new method, called surrogate model assisted differential evolution for antenna synthesis (SADEA), is presented in this paper. The key ideas are: (1) A Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model is constructed on-line to predict the performances of the candidate designs, saving a lot of computationally expensive EM simulations. (2) A novel surrogate model-aware evolutionary search mechanism is proposed, directing effective global search even when a traditional high-quality surrogate model is not available. Three complex antennas and two mathematical benchmark problems are selected as examples. Compared with the widely used differential evolution and particle swarm optimization, SADEA can obtain comparable results, but achieves a 3 to 7 times speed enhancement for antenna design optimization.},

We first present a novel derivation of the Hashin--Shtrikman (HS) bounds for multi-phase composites and the associated attainment condition. The attainment condition asserts that the HS bound is attainable if, and only if, there exists a second gradient field that is constant in all but the matrix phases. By restricting and constructing such second gradient fields, we obtain a series of sufficient conditions such that the HS bounds are attainable or unattainable. These attainability and unattainability results appear new for a generic situation. For special situations, our attainability and unattainability results recover the results of Milton (1981 Phys.

This sparse representation can be utilized for dimensionality reduction and dataset generation, enabling effective analysis and optimization of photonic topologies with data-driven approaches. As a proof of principle, we leverage our encoding method for the design of two dimensional non-paraxial diffractive optical elements with various diffraction intensity distributions.

This article demonstrates a wavelength- and OAM-tunable vortex laser at 1.6 {$\mu$}m in an Er:YAG system. For the first time to the best of our knowledge, a reflective volume Bragg grating (VBG) was theoretically and experimentally proved to be an effective OAMpreserving wavelength selector inside the laser cavity. A z-shaped laser cavity employing a VBG as a folding mirror was constructed for the direct generation of vortex beams, and we finally obtained wavelength-tunable beams of five OAM states (0, {$\pm$} {$\Elzxh $}, and {$\pm$} 2{$\Elzxh $}) with a narrow bandwidth less than 0.04 nm. This laser supplies a new way for optical communication by combining the spatial degree of freedom for multiplexing information channels with the conventionally used wavelength domains in packable and robust resonant cavity.},

Here, we report a deep-learning-based model, comprising two bidirectional neural networks assembled by a partial stacking strategy, to automatically design and optimize three-dimensional chiral metamaterials with strong chiroptical responses at predesignated wavelengths. The model can help to discover the intricate, nonintuitive relationship between a metamaterial structure and its optical responses from a number of training examples, which circumvents the timeconsuming, case-by-case numerical simulations in conventional metamaterial designs. This approach not only realizes the forward prediction of optical performance much more accurately and efficiently but also enables one to inversely retrieve designs from given requirements. Our results demonstrate that such a data-driven model can be applied as a very powerful tool in studying complicated light-matter interactions and accelerating the on-demand design of nanophotonic devices, systems, and architectures for real world applications.},

 abstract = {Some of the greatest scientists including Poisson, Faraday, Maxwell, Rayleigh, and Einstein have contributed to the theory of composite materials. Mathematically, it is the study of partial differential equations with rapid oscillations in their coefficients. Although extensively studied for more than a hundred years, an explosion of ideas in the last five decades (and particularly in the last three decades) has dramatically increased our understanding of the relationship between the properties of the constituent materials, the underlying microstructure of a composite, and the overall effective (electrical, thermal, elastic) moduli which govern the macroscopic behavior. This renaissance has been fueled by the technological need for improving our knowledge base of composites, by the advance of the underlying mathematical theory of homogenization, by the discovery of new variational principles, by the recognition of how important the subject is to solving structural optimization problems, and by the realization of the connection with the mathematical problem of quasiconvexification. This 2002 book surveys these exciting developments at the frontier of mathematics.},

Different spectral representations of the Green's function are derived using the Mittag-Leffler theorem, and their convergence to the exact solution is analyzed, allowing us to select optimal representations. Based on them, more efficient versions of the resonant-state expansion (RSE) are formulated, with a particular focus on the static mode contribution, including versions of the RSE with a complete elimination of static modes. These general versions of the RSE, applicable to non-spherical optical systems, are verified and illustrated on exactly solvable examples of a dielectric sphere in vacuum with perturbations of its size and refractive index, demonstrating the same level of convergence to the exact solution for both transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarizations.},

 abstract = {When function forms in mathematical models can not be given explicitly in terms of design variables, the values of functions are usually given by numerical/ real experiments. Since those experiments are often expensive, it is important to develop techniques for finding a solution with as less number of experiments as possible. To this end, the model predictive optimization methods aim to find an optimal solution in parallel with predicting the function forms in mathematical models. Successive approximate optimization or metamodeling are of the same terminology. So far, several kinds of methods have been developed for this purpose. Among them, response surface method, design of experiments, Kriging method, active learning methods and methods using computational intelligence are well known. However, the subject of those methods is mainly static optimization. For dynamic optimization problems, the model predictive control has been developed along a similar idea to the above. This chapter discusses multi-objective model predictive control problems and proposes a method using computational intelligence such as support vector regression.},

 abstract = {Wrap-around invisibility cloak An invisibility cloak can be used to conceal an object from view by guiding light around it. Most cloaks developed so far have bulky structures that are difficult to scale up for hiding large objects. To design a thin invisibility cloak that can be wrapped around an object such as a sheet or skin, Ni et al. designed a two-dimensional metamaterial surface. Such flexible, highly reflective materials could be manufactured at large scale to hide large objects. Science, this issue p. 1310 Metamaterial-based optical cloaks have thus far used volumetric distribution of the material properties to gradually bend light and thereby obscure the cloaked region. Hence, they are bulky and hard to scale up and, more critically, typical carpet cloaks introduce unnecessary phase shifts in the reflected light, making the cloaks detectable. Here, we demonstrate experimentally an ultrathin invisibility skin cloak wrapped over an object. This skin cloak conceals a three-dimensional arbitrarily shaped object by complete restoration of the phase of the reflected light at 730-nanometer wavelength. The skin cloak comprises a metasurface with distributed phase shifts rerouting light and rendering the object invisible. In contrast to bulky cloaks with volumetric index variation, our device is only 80 nanometer (about one-ninth of the wavelength) thick and potentially scalable for hiding macroscopic objects. A metamaterial surface can be designed to operate as an invisibility skin cloak. A metamaterial surface can be designed to operate as an invisibility skin cloak.},

For example, it shows how the regularization of some parameters of the EDAs probabilistic models can yield dramatic improvements in efficiency. In this context a new class, Shrinkage EDAs, based on shrinkage estimation is presented. Also, a novelmutation operator based on a regularization of the entropy is discussed. Another key contribution of the chapter is the development of a new surrogate fitness model based on the search distributions. With this method the evolution starts in the fitness landscape, switches to the log-probability landscape of the model and then backtracks to continue in the original landscape if the optimum is not found. For the sake of completeness the chapter reviews other techniques for improving the sampling efficiency of EDAs. The theoretical presentation is accompanied by numerical simulations that support the main claims of the chapter.},

 abstract = {Electromagnetic wave absorbers have been investigated for many years with the aim of achieving high absorbance and tunability of both the absorption wavelength and the operation mode by geometrical control, small and thin absorber volume, and simple fabrication. There is particular interest in metal-insulator-metal-based plasmonic metamaterial absorbers (MIM-PMAs) due to their complete fulfillment of these demands. MIM-PMAs consist of top periodic micropatches, a middle dielectric layer, and a bottom reflector layer to generate strong localized surface plasmon resonance at absorption wavelengths. In particular, in the visible and infrared (IR) wavelength regions, a wide range of applications is expected, such as solar cells, refractive index sensors, optical camouflage, cloaking, optical switches, color pixels, thermal IR sensors, IR microscopy and gas sensing. The promising properties of MIM-PMAs are attributed to the simple plasmonic resonance localized at the top micropatch resonators formed by the MIMs. Here, various types of MIM-PMAs are reviewed in terms of their historical background, basic physics, operation mode design, and future challenges to clarify their underlying basic design principles and introduce various applications. The principles presented in this review paper can be applied to other wavelength regions such as the ultraviolet, terahertz, and microwave regions.},

The electrical and optical constants and polarization-reversal properties of these ceramics were determined as functions of grain size and porosity. When poled PLZT ceramics were aged, the polarization-reversal characteristic was quite asymmetric, apparently because a space-charge field, E8p, was generated during aging. From a detailed study of the behavior of the E8p, including its (1) generation with increasing aging time, (2) relaxation with repeated polarization reversals, (3) relaxation by heat depolarization, and (4) grain-size and porosity dependence, it is concluded that the space-charge layer is present inside every domain. This layer also explains the grain-size dependencies of the remanent polarization, piezoelectric constants, and Curie point.},

In the finest ceramics the permittivity reduces below 1000 and a tendency to linearization of the permittivity vs field dependence is observed. The composite structure of ferroelectric ceramics corresponding to ferroelectric grain cores separated by nonferroelectric grain boundaries determines a progressive increase of the electrical inhomogeneity of the system with decreasing GS. The local electric field was computed at various applied voltages for different GSs by a finite element approach, and then the effective permittivity-field response {$\varepsilon $}eff(E) was determined by taking into consideration the local field distribution. A remarkable agreement between the model and experimental data was obtained for BaTiO3 ceramics. The local field distribution explains with considerable accuracy the reduction of permittivity and tunability observed with decreasing GS as well as the tendency towards linearization of {$\varepsilon $}eff(E) in nanoceramics.},

Here, we report an interesting manifestation of spin Hall effect of light and demonstrate its tunability in an inhomogeneous anisotropic medium exhibiting spatially varying retardance level. In our system, the beam shift occurs only for one circular polarization mode keeping the other orthogonal mode unaffected, which is shown to arise due to the combined spatial gradients of the geometric phase and the dynamical phase of light. The constituent two orthogonal circular polarization modes of an input linearly polarized light evolve in different trajectories, eventually manifesting as a large and tunable spin separation. The spin dependent beam shift and the demonstrated principle of simultaneously tailoring space-varying geometric and dynamical phase of light for achieving its tunability (of both magnitude and direction), may provide an attractive route towards development of spin-optical devices.},

 abstract = {Optical metasurfaces (subwavelength-patterned surfaces typically described by variable effective surface impedances) are typically modeled by an approximation akin to ray optics: the reflection or transmission of an incident wave at each point of the surface is computed as if the surface were \&\#x0201C;locally uniform,\&\#x0201D; and then the total field is obtained by summing all of these local scattered fields via a Huygens principle. (Similar approximations are found in scalar diffraction theory and in ray optics for curved surfaces.) In this paper, we develop a precise theory of such approximations for variable-impedance surfaces. Not only do we obtain a type of adiabatic theorem showing that the \&\#x0201C;zeroth-order\&\#x0201D; locally uniform approximation converges in the limit as the surface varies more and more slowly, including a way to quantify the rate of convergence, but we also obtain an infinite series of higher-order corrections. These corrections, which can be computed to any desired order by performing integral operations on the surface fields, allow rapidly varying surfaces to be modeled with arbitrary accuracy, and also allow one to validate designs based on the zeroth-order approximation (which is often surprisingly accurate) without resorting to expensive brute-force Maxwell solvers. We show that our formulation works arbitrarily close to the surface, and can even compute coupling to guided modes, whereas in the far-field limit our zeroth-order result simplifies to an expression similar to what has been used by other authors.},

To optimize surfaces that can be thousands of wavelengths in diameter, with thousands (or millions) of parameters, the key is a fast approximate solver for the scattered field. We employ a \&\#x0201C;locally periodic\&\#x0201D; approximation in which the scattering problem is approximated by a composition of periodic scattering problems from each unit cell of the surface, and validate it against brute-force Maxwell solutions. This is an extension of ideas in previous metasurface designs, but with greatly increased flexibility, e.g. to automatically balance tradeoffs between multiple frequencies or to optimize a photonic device given only partial information about the desired field. Our approach even extends beyond the metasurface regime to non-subwavelength structures where additional diffracted orders must be included (but the period is not large enough to apply scalar diffraction theory).},

In this paper, we present an evolutionary approach to HLS that extends previous works in three respects: (i) we exploit the NSGA-II, a multi-objective genetic algorithm, to fully automate the design space explorationwithout the need of any human intervention, (ii) we replace the expensive evaluation process of candidate solutions with a quite accurate regression model, and (iii) we reduce the number of evaluations with a fitness inheritance scheme. We tested our approach on several benchmark problems. Our results suggest that all the enhancements introduced improve the overall performance of the evolutionary search.},

Essentially, the purpose of the topological derivative method is to measure the sensitivity of a given shape functional with respect to a singular domain perturbation, so that it has applications in many relevant fields such as shape and topology optimization for imaging processing, inverse problems, and design of metamaterials. The topological derivative is rigorously derived for the electromagnetic scattering problem and used as gradient descent direction to find local optima for the design of electromagnetic devices. We demonstrate that the resulting topology design algorithm is remarkably simple and efficient and naturally leads to binary designs, while depending only on the solution of the conventional finite element formulation for electrodynamics. Finally, several numerical experiments in two and three spatial dimensions are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed formulation.},

We propose a phenomenological correction to the static formulae using a realistic assumption for the electric field behavior inside the metal features. This approach allows us to obtain analytical expressions for the effective permittivity in the case when the electric field is not sufficiently homogeneous within the unit cell of the gratings. A comparison with the numerical results of the Fourier modal method demonstrates the validity of the analytical formulae. Additional study is made on the impedance approximation at the outer boundaries of the periodical structure in order to propose analytical formulae for the reflection coefficient that permits better correspondence with the numerical results. The link between the values of effective permittivity and permeability defined as the ratios between the averaged fields, and the metamaterial permittivity and permeability is discussed.},

Science 2014, 343, 160-163), we suggest a practical approach to its realization that involves reflective metasurfaces consisting of arrayed gold nanobricks atop a subwavelength-thin dielectric spacer and optically thick gold film, a configuration that supports gap-surface plasmon resonances. Using well-established numerical routines, we demonstrate that these metasurfaces enable independent control of the light phase and amplitude, and design differentiator and integrator metasurfaces featuring realistic system parameters. Proof-of-principle experiments are reported along with the successful realization of a high-quality poor-man's integrator metasurface operating at the wavelength of 800 nm.},

All possible structures with hexagonal symmetry are presented; furthermore, we demonstrate effects that are solely reliant upon a square arrangement of nanoparticles. We demonstrate these effects by means of scattering computations based on the coupled dipole method that encompass the full electromagnetic interactions between nanoparticles.},

A relationship between the first eigenmode and an expression of the polarizability is proposed for a split-ring resonator. It thus allows us to describe a link between the artificial magnetic response of a split-ring resonator and modal characteristics. Using the new metrics proposed, a reactive impedance substrate based on metal-dielectric metamaterial excited by a parallel magnetic field is shown to exhibit artificial magnetism. These metrics are shown to propose good agreement with other analytical and numerical methods. This analysis should be useful when such metal-dielectric metamaterial structures are associated to radiating elements like antennas since it could be performed in the near-field region, unlike common approaches based on plane wave and far-field assumptions.},

Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge--Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction--diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.},

 abstract = {The interaction of circularly polarized light with matter is the basis for molecular circular dichroism spectroscopy, optical spin manipulation, and optical torques. However, chiroptical effects are usually hampered by weak chiral light--matter interaction. Nanophotonic structures can enhance optical intensity to boost interactions, but magnifying chiral effects requires that the near field remains chiral in the process. Here, we propose the conditions and limits for enhancing different chiroptical effects near achiral metasurfaces with maximum chirality of the evanescent fields. We illustrate these conditions with arrays of metal and dielectric nanodisks and decompose their distinct electromagnetic metrics into propagating and evanescent Fourier orders. We prove that a nanostructure cannot be universally optimal for different chirality metrics and therefore applications. For example, arrays tailored for enhanced spin excitation with spatially uniform circular polarization destroy circular dichroism. Conversely, we predict a limit of maximum attainable circular dichroism in highly evanescent Fourier orders through a simple relation with the evanescent wavevector and polarization. Our results establish guidelines and constraints for nanophotonic enhancement using evanescent fields in diverse chiroptical applications.},

 abstract = {An open-source program named VeloxChem has been developed for the calculation of electronic real and complex linear response functions at the levels of Hartree--Fock and Kohn--Sham density functional theories. With an object-oriented program structure written in a Python/C++ layered fashion, VeloxChem enables time-efficient prototyping of novel scientific approaches without sacrificing computational efficiency, so that molecular systems involving up to and beyond 500 second-row atoms (or some 10,000 contracted and in part diffuse Gaussian basis functions) can be routinely addressed. In addition, VeloxChem is equipped with a polarizable embedding scheme for the treatment of the classical electrostatic interactions with an environment that in turn is modeled by atomic site charges and polarizabilities. The underlying hybrid message passing interface (MPI)/open multiprocessing (OpenMP) parallelization scheme makes VeloxChem suitable for execution in high-performance computing cluster environments, showing even slightly beyond linear scaling for the Fock matrix construction with use of up to 16,384 central processing unit (CPU) cores. An efficient---with respect to convergence rate and overall computational cost---multifrequency/gradient complex linear response equation solver enables calculations not only of conventional spectra, such as visible/ultraviolet/X-ray electronic absorption and circular dichroism spectra, but also time-resolved linear response signals as due to ultra-short weak laser pulses.

 abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms have been very popular for solving multiobjective optimization problems, mainly because of their ease of use, and their wide applicability. However, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) tend to consume an important number of objective function evaluations, in order to achieve a reasonably good approximation of the Pareto front. This is a major concern when attempting to use MOEAs for real-world applications, since we can normally afford only a fairly limited number of fitness function evaluations in such cases. Despite these concerns, relatively few efforts have been reported in the literature to reduce the computational cost of MOEAs. It has been until relatively recently, that researchers have developed techniques to achieve an effective reduction of fitness function evaluations by exploiting knowledge acquired during the search. In this chapter, we analyze different proposals currently available in the specialized literature to deal with expensive functions in evolutionary multi-objective optimization. Additionally, we review some real-world applications of these methods, which can be seen as case studies in which such techniques led to a substantial reduction in the computational cost of the MOEA adopted. Finally, we also indicate some of the potential paths for future research in this area.},

The contrast formation between domains by spontaneous birefringence and reciprocal rotatory power in transmission, and by bireflectance, specular reflection and etching in reflected light are considered. A symmetry classification for the birefringence and rotatory power contrast formation is proposed. The use of PLM for ceramic materials encounters difficulties, which can be overcome by enhancing grain growth and reducing sources of light scattering. Some examples are given, demonstrating the great power of PLM, if used in conjunction with other physical measurements.},

 abstract = {This paper introduces an electro-mechanically coupled phase field model for ferroelectric domain evolution based on an invariant formulation for transversely isotropic piezoelectric material behavior. The thermodynamic framework rests upon Gurtin's notion of a micro-force system in conjunction with an associated micro-force balance. This leads to a formulation of the second law, from which a generalized Ginzburg--Landau evolution equation is derived. The invariant formulation of the thermodynamic potential provides a consistent way to obtain the order parameter dependent elastic stiffness, piezoelectric, and dielectric tensor. The model is reduced to 2d and implemented into a finite element framework. The material constants used in the simulations are adapted to meet the thermodynamic condition of a vanishing micro-force. It is found that the thermodynamic potential taken from the literature has to be extended in order to avoid a loss of positive definiteness of the stiffness and the dielectric tensor. The small-signal response is investigated in the presence and in the absence of the additional regularizing terms in the potential. The simulations show the pathological behavior of the model in case these terms are not taken into account. The paper closes with microstructure simulations concerning a ferroelectric nanodot subjected to an electric field, a cracked single crystal, and a ferroelectric bi-crystal.},

 abstract = {Research and development efforts on ferroelectric memories have been underway since about 1955. The early work, largely at IBM, RCA, Bell Telephone Laboratories and other US industrial laboratories was stymied by two problems: Firstly, the materials were too thick to permit operation at 5 V, the standard ``TTL'' or ``CMOS'' operating voltages in the silicon integrated circuit technology that dominates the microelectronics industry; and second, there is considerable ``crosstalk'' and unintentional switching of cells laid out in simple row-and-column matrix form. In the 1990s, however, the perspective is very different: Techniques for depositing very thin, pinholefree films have developed significantly in the past three decades; at present sputtering, sol-gel spinon, laser ablation, and various other techniques (MOD, MOCVD, etc.) can all be used to prepare optically uniform films over full 4' to 6' wafers, capable of withstanding 4 MV/cm or more. And the old problem of cross-talk or ``half-select disturb pulses'' has been circumvented by designing memory arrays in which each ferroelectric cell is isolated from its neighbors by one or two transistors (``IT'' or ``2T'' DRAM architecture) or as many as six transistors (in a more conservative ``6T'' SRAM lay-out). As a result, there has been a renaissance of engineering interest in ferroelectric thin films.},

 abstract = {Programmable metasurfaces have recently been proposed to dynamically manipulate electromagnetic (EM) waves in both temporal and spatial dimensions. With active components integrated into unit cells of the metasurface, states of the unit cells can be adjusted by digital codes. The metasurface can then construct complex spatial and temporal electromagnetic beams. Given the main parameters of the beam, the optimal codes can be computed by nonlinear optimization algorithms, such as genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, etc. The high computational complexity of these algorithms makes it very challenging to compute the codes in real time. In this study, we applied deep learning techniques to compute the codes. A deep convolutional neural network is designed and trained to compute the required element codes in milliseconds, given the requirement of the waveform. The average accuracy of the prediction reaches more than 94 percent. This scheme is validated on a 1-bit programmable metasurface and both experimental and numerical results agree with each other well. This study shows that machines may ``learn'' the physics of modulating electromagnetic waves with the help of the good generalization ability in deep convolutional neural networks. The proposed scheme may provide us with a possible solution for real-time complex beamforming in antenna arrays, such as the programmable metasurface.},

Our study seeks to understand the computational challenges of regression estimation's underlying optimization problem and design intelligent procedures for this setting. We begin by analyzing the size of the parameter space in polynomial regression in terms of the number of variables and the constraints on the polynomial degree and the number of interacting explanatory variables.We subsequently propose a new procedure for statistical estimation that relies upon cross-validation to select the optimal parameter subspace and an evolutionary algorithm to minimize risk within this subspace based upon the available data. This general purpose procedure can be shown to perform well in a variety of challenging multivariate estimation settings. Furthermore, the procedure is sufficiently flexible to allow the user to incorporate known causal structures into the estimate and to adjust computational parameters such as the population mutation rate according to the problem's specific challenges. Furthermore, the procedure can be shown to asymptotically converge to the globally optimal estimate. We compare this evolutionary algorithm to a variety of competitors over the course of simulation studies and in the context of a study of disease progression in diabetes patients.},

 abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) used in complex optimization domains usually need to perform a large number of fitness function evaluations in order to get near-optimal solutions. In real world application domains such as engineering design problems, such evaluations can be extremely computationally expensive. In some extreme cases there is no clear definition of the fitness function or the fitness function is too ambiguous to be deterministically evaluated. It is therefore common to estimate or approximate the fitness. A popular method is to construct a so-called surrogate or meta-model, which can simulate the behavior of the original fitness function, but can be evaluated much faster. An interesting trend is to use multiple surrogates to gain better performance in fitness approximation. In this chapter, an up-to-date survey of fitness approximation applied in evolutionary algorithms is presented. The main focus areas are the methods of fitness approximation, the working styles of fitness approximation, and the management of the approximation during the optimization process. To conclude, some open questions in this area are discussed.},

The work started with the simple evaporation of BaTiO3 by Feldman (1955), and accelerated during the 1970's with the advent of sputtering technologies. Since that time some totally new techniques and innovative processes have been introduced. The ability to routinely fabricate films having good ferroelectric properties in sub- micron thicknesses, and to demonstrate marketable products such as non-volatile memories and electro-optic switches has generated an immense interest in integrated ferroelectrics. Progress has been made in three areas: (1) theresearch and development of new processing technologies, (2) methods for accelerated testing and property measurement, and (3) the development of novel thin film devices utilizing the functional properties of ferroelectrics. Further advances in these areas are linked to an improved understanding of (1) the theory of nucleation and film growth related to composition, (2) the dependence of film properties on thickness, (3) concerns related to the compatibility of ferroelectrics with electrode materials, and (4) reliability issues.},

The effective permittivity was discussed by using Effective Medium Approximation and Finite Element Method approaches. The role of porosity and specific microstructural characteristics induced by the pore forming addition, from closed porosity (0--3) towards a combined (0--3, 2--2) with lamellar-type of microstructures for the most porous ceramics was taken into consideration.

The metasurface consists of disk-like ferroelectric resonators arrayed on a metal film and the upper surface of resonators is covered by ion gel film which is transparent for incident electromagnetic wave. Using the metal film and ion gel film as electrodes, the permittivity of the resonators can be adjusted by an external electric field and, as a result, the reflection phase of the resonators can be dynamically adjusted in a relatively wide range. By programmable controlling the electric field strength applied on resonators of metasurface, a 2{$\pi$} phase ramp can be realized and, thereby, the arbitrary reflection behavior of incident waves with varied frequency is obtained. Because of the tunability, this metasurface can also be used to design adaptive metasurface lens and carpet cloak.},

Then, new frontiers of modern artificial neural network surrogate modeling are reviewed with regard to exploiting the hidden information for bringing new perspectives to optimization by exploring new data form and patterns, e.g. quick provision of candidates of better aerodynamic performance via accumulated database instead of random seeding, and envisions of more physical understanding being injected to the data manipulation.},

 abstract = {This chapter presents an evolutionary approach for solving the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and the TSP with backhauls (TSPB). We propose two evolutionary algorithms for solving the difficult TSPs. Our focus is on developing evolutionary operators based on conventional heuristics. We rely on a set of detailed computational experiments and statistical tests for developing an effective algorithm.The chapter starts with a careful survey of the algorithms for the TSP and the TSPB, with a special emphasis on crossover and mutation operators and applications on benchmark test instances. The second part addresses our first evolutionary algorithm. We explore the use of two tour construction heuristics, nearest neighbor and greedy, in developing new crossover operators.We focus on preserving the edges in the union graph constructed by edges of the parent tours.We let the heuristics exploit the building blocks found in this graph. This way, new solutions can inherit good blocks from both parents. We also combine the two crossover operators together in generating offspring to explore the potential gain due to synergy. In addition, we make use of 2-edge exchange moves as the mutation operator to incorporate more problem specific information in the evolution process. Our reproduction strategy is based on the generational approach. Experimental results indicate that our operators are promising in terms of both solution quality and computation time.In the third part of the chapter, we present the second evolutionary algorithm developed. This part can be thought of as an enhancement of the first algorithm. A common practice with such algorithms is to generate one child or two children from two parents. In the second implementation, we investigate the preservation of good edges available in more than two parents and generate multiple children.We use the steady-state evolution as a reproduction strategy this time and test the replacement of the worst parent or the worst population member to find the better replacement strategy. Our two mutation operators try to eliminate the longest and randomly selected edges and a third operator makes use of the cheapest insertion heuristic. The algorithm is finalized after conducting a set of experiments for best parameter settings and testing on larger TSPLIB instances. The second evolutionary algorithm is also implemented for solving randomly generated instances of the TSPB. Our experiments reveal that the algorithm is significantly better than the competitors in the literature. The last part concludes the chapter.},

Four years ago (Tagantsev, 1987a; 1987b; 1988) it was suggested that this group of ferroelectrics should be considered as a special class of ferroelectrics ---{} the class of weak ferroelectrics. This article is devoted to the discussion of the main issues of this concept.

To metallize the inner and outer surfaces of the monolithic structure, nonradiating slots are added on the surface of the designed SWAA. The surface roughness is taken into account by employing the Huray-model methodology in simulation.

 abstract = {In this chapter, a rough approximation model, which is an approximation model with low accuracy and without learning process, is presented in order to reduce the number of function evaluations effectively. Although the approximation errors between the true function values and the approximation values are not small, the rough model can estimate the order relation of solutions with fair accuracy. By utilizing this nature of the rough model, we have proposed estimated comparison method, in which function evaluations are omitted when the order relation of solutions can be judged by approximation values. In the method, a parameter for error margin is introduced to avoid incorrect judgment. Also, a parameter for utilizing congestion of solutions is introduced to avoid omitting promising solutions. In order to improve the stability and efficiency of the method, we propose adaptive control of the margin parameter and the congestion parameter according to the success rate of the judgment. The advantage of these improvements is shown by comparing the results obtained by Differential Evolution (DE), DE with the estimated comparison method, adaptively controlled DE with the estimated comparison method and particle swarm optimization in various types of benchmark functions.},

In particular, a convexified energy density is formulated based on domain volume fractions and extended to polycrystals via the common Taylor assumption of uniform strains (alternative descriptions are discussed as well). The chosen kinetic relations admit to account for differences in 90$^\circ$- and 180$^\circ$-domain wall motion and rate effects. The model is applied to tetragonal barium titanate (BaTiO3) and we present results for both material point calculations and finite element simulations, which demonstrate good qualitative agreement with experiments. We deliberately target bulk polycrystalline ferroelectrics in contrast to thin films that have been studied extensively.},

Specifically, these 2D metamaterials contain nine types of left-handed nanostructure arrays, including U-like, T-like, and I-like shapes. Both the traditional rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) method and DL approach are utilized to study the circular dichroism (CD) in higher-order diffraction beams. One common feature of these chiral metamaterials is that they all exhibit the weakest intensity but the strongest CD response in the third-order diffracted beams. Our work suggests that the DL model can predict CD performance of a 2D chiral nanostructure with a computational speed that is four orders of magnitude faster than RCWA but preserves high accuracy. The DL model\&\#x00A0;introduced in this work shows great potentials in exploring various chiroptical interactions in metamaterials and accelerating the design of hypersensitive photonic devices.},

 abstract = {Designing modern photonic devices often involves traversing a large parameter space via an optimization procedure, gradient based or otherwise, and typically results in the designer performing electromagnetic simulations of a large number of correlated devices. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of accelerating electromagnetic simulations using the data collected from such correlated simulations. In particular, we present an approach to accelerate the Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) algorithm for the solution of frequency-domain Maxwell's equations using two machine learning models (principal component analysis and a convolutional neural network). These data-driven models are trained to predict a subspace within which the solution of the frequency-domain Maxwell's equations approximately lies. This subspace is then used for augmenting the Krylov subspace generated during the GMRES iterations, thus effectively reducing the size of the Krylov subspace and hence the number of iterations needed for solving Maxwell's equations. By training the proposed models on a dataset of wavelength-splitting gratings, we show an order of magnitude reduction (\textasciitilde 10--50) in the number of GMRES iterations required for solving frequency-domain Maxwell's equations.},

The technique makes use of Dispersive Quasi-Normal Modes (DQNMs), also known as natural modes of photonic structures, obtained by solving spectral problems associated to Maxwell's equations. The final expansion formula, based on a simple version of Keldysh's theorem, reveals the contributions of eigenmodes onto the scattered field, allowing us to understand the scattering properties of arbitrary shaped nanophotonic structures (bounded or unbounded), where permeability and permittivity can be dispersive, anisotropic, and even possibly nonreciprocal. This provides complete physical insights to the spectral characteristics of given structures as well as a transparent interpretation of numerical results. We demonstrate this modal analysis on a 2-D model of diffraction grating, made of a periodic slit array etched in a free-standing silver membrane.},

At this particular stage, an insufficient consideration for uncertainty could lead to a wrong decision on the feasibility of the mission. Contrary to the traditional margin approach, the methodology presented here explicitly introduces uncertainties in the design process. The overall system design is then optimised, minimising the impact of uncertainties on the optimal value of the design criteria. Evidence Theory, used as the framework to model uncertainties, is presented in details. Although its use in the design process would greatly improve the quality of the design, it increases significantly the computational cost of any multidisciplinary optimisation. Therefore, two approaches to tackle an Optimisation Problem Under Uncertainties are proposed: (a) a direct solution through a multi-objective optimisation algorithm and (b) an indirect solution through a clustering algorithm. Both methods are presented, highlighting the techniques used to reduce the computational time. It will be shown in particular that the indirect method is an attractive alternative when the complexity of the problem increases.},

 abstract = {Domain structures as typically found in tetragonally polarized ferroelectrics are investigated regarding their large-signal behavior by conducting phase-field simulations. The underlying free energy function of the phase-field model stems from a completely knowledge-based multiscale adjustment approach (V\"olker et al 2011 Contin. Mech. Thermodyn. 23 435--451) and is based on results from atomistic DFT calculations and SMP simulations. We address the question of whether phase-field models in such a multiscale simulation approach are capable of yielding reasonable values for the coercive electric field strength, i.e. the electric fields necessary to initiate irreversible switching processes in the domain structure, causing the experimentally observed hysteresis behavior of ferroelectrics. Therefore, a variety of typical ferroelectric bulk domain structures are taken into account and studied regarding their large-signal behavior. Trends are shown in the correlation between the complexity of the domain structure and the coercive field strength predicted by the phase-field model. The role of imperfections in the material such as charged defects and grain boundaries is of special interest, since they act as nucleation centers for new domains under electric loading. In this way, they reduce significantly the coercive field strength from the value given by the energy barrier in the free energy to magnitudes close to or of the order observed in experiments on polycrystalline ferroelectrics.},

ANN applications in computational electromagnetics are also discussed. Great efficiency can be achieved by using ANNs to approximate the computationally intensive calculations in solving Maxwell equations using method of moments (MoM). As illustrated in examples, these ANN-based techniques are capable of fast and accurate EM modeling and MoM computation, and useful for efficient EM based design.},

The temporal evolution of the polarization switching shows that the switching is a process of nucleation, if needed, and growth of energy-favorite domains. Macroscopic polarization and strain are obtained by averaging polarizations and strains over the entire simulated ferroelectric. The simulation results successfully reveal the hysteresis loop of macroscopic polarization versus the applied electric field, the butterfly curve of macroscopic strain versus the applied electric field, and the macroscopically nonlinear strain response to applied compressive stresses.},

This device consists of uniformly segmented sectors of high efficiency MIM metasurface. With each of the segment sector functioning as a local quarter-wave-plate (QWP), the device is designed to convert circularly polarized incidence into local linear polarization to create an overall radial polarization with corresponding binary phases and extremely high dynamic range amplitude modulation. The capability of such devices enables the generation of nearly arbitrarily complex optical fields that may find broad applications that transcend disciplinary boundaries.},

This paper proposes a new topological shape optimization method for systematic computational design of a type of mechanical metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratios (auxetic materials), which integrates the numerical homogenization approach into a powerful parametric level set method (PLSM). The homogenization method is used to obtain the effective properties of the periodic microstructure, while the PLSM is applied to achieve shape evolutions and topological changes of the microstructure, until the desired material properties are achieved. The key concept of the PLSM is the interpolation of the implicit level set surface by using a given set of compactly supported radial basis functions (CSRBF), which are positioned at a number of given and fixed knots inside the design domain. Several typical numerical examples are used to demonstrate the favorable characteristics of the proposed method in the design of micro-structured metamaterials.},

 abstract = {Porous ceramics with type 3--3 connectivity were prepared and investigated with a view to their application for ultrasound transducers. Ceramics with a porosity in the order of 0.4 to 0.5 exhibit sufficiently high permittivity ({$\approx$} 500), a thickness coupling factor equalling that of dense material ({$\approx$} 0.5), a low transverse coupling factor, a low vibrational Q ({$\approx$} 20) and low acoustic impedance ({$\approx$} 9{$\cdot$}106kg/m2{$\cdot$}s), all of which indicates their eminent suitability as a material for the fabrication of transducers as used in medical diagnostics. The experimentally determined influence of the porosity on the dielectric constants of these materials was used for the critical testing of various theories for calculating the constants of multiphase materials. It was found that the dielectric and elastic constants of porous piezoelectric ceramics can be very satisfactorily described on the basis of Bruggeman's theory, which has fallen somewhat into obscurity. Their piezoelectric properties are discussed with reference to an effective medium approximation and a cell model.},

This problem belongs to the class of NP-hard problems and lots of research works have been performed to develop a practical and efficient heuristic algorithm. This chapter surveys up-to-date research efforts to address the reliable network design problem and proposes a new hybrid heuristic of the genetic algorithm and local search ant colony system. The proposed hybrid heuristic represents a twoedge- connected candidate network as multiple rings. The genetic algorithm evolves a population of multi-ring-encoded individuals with special genetic operators while the local search ant colony system fine-tunes each ring. The results of computer experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed hybrid heuristic.},

DSNNs are trained to respond to a target word (TW) said by one female speaker or by 8 male and 8 female speakers. The response of the single-speaker trained DSNNs to all 16 speakers is similar to the 16-speaker-trained DSNN responses. TW training results in an ordering of the expected responses to the 9 words of the non-TW set. The ordering determined by single-speaker training matches the ordering determined by multi-speaker training; and in many instances, the single-speaker trained DSNN output matches the multi-speaker trained DSNN output. While searching the parameter space to best solve the isolated word recognition task, the GA implicitly searched the input space to find the input subset best describing the separatrix between TWs and non-TWs. Computation is decreased by concentrating optimization on this subset. The GA adapts as knowledge of this subset is learned. The GA begins as a random search, becoming a steady state GA and then a simple elitist GA over the course of optimization.},

Dense Ba0.6Sr0.4TiO3 (BST) ceramics, with different grain sizes, were prepared in order to optimise the dielectric tunability via polar nano cluster effects. Dielectric permittivity and loss measurements were carried at both high and low frequencies and were supported by results from X-ray powder diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopies, Raman spectroscopy and piezoresponse force microscopy. The concentration of polar nano clusters, whose sizes are found to be in the range 20 to 50\,nm, and the dielectric tunability increase with increasing grain size. A novel method for measurement of the microwave tunability in bulk dielectrics is presented. The highest tunability of 32\% is achieved in ceramics with an average grain size of 10\,{$\mu$}m.

 abstract = {Optical analog computing offers high-throughput low-power-consumption operation for specialized computational tasks. Traditionally, optical analog computing in the spatial domain uses a bulky system of lenses and filters. Recent developments in metamaterials enable the miniaturization of such computing elements down to a subwavelength scale. However, the required metamaterial consists of a complex array of meta-atoms, and direct demonstration of image processing is challenging. Here, we show that the interference effects associated with surface plasmon excitations at a single metal--dielectric interface can perform spatial differentiation. And we experimentally demonstrate edge detection of an image without any Fourier lens. This work points to a simple yet powerful mechanism for optical analog computing at the nanoscale.},

Since Ba0.6Sr0.4TiO3 (BST) and BaZr0.3Ti0.7O3 (BZT) bulk ceramics exhibit high tunability ({$\tau$}={$\epsilon$}0-{$\epsilon$}Emax{$\epsilon$}0) near room temperature, both compositions have been chosen for preparation of screen printed thick films. Low frequency dielectric properties have been characterized using metal-insulator-metal capacitor structures in a temperature range of -120 $^\circ$C to +160 $^\circ$C. Measurements of the bias dependent permittivity show a hysteresis effect in both materials in the whole investigated temperature range. BZT thick films exhibit a more diffuse phase transition than BST and therefore a lower temperature dependence. Permittivity, dielectric loss and tunability have also been determined at microwave frequencies from 4 to 90 GHz. Temperature and frequency dependence of the dielectric losses and tunability of both materials have been compared.},

 abstract = {Wave propagation in a double negative (DNG) medium, i.e., a medium having negative permittivity and negative permeability, is studied both analytically and numerically. The choices of the square root that leads to the index of refraction and the wave impedance in a DNG medium are determined by imposing analyticity in the complex frequency domain, and the corresponding wave properties associated with each choice are presented. These monochromatic concepts are then tested critically via a one-dimensional finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulation of the propagation of a causal, pulsed plane wave in a matched, lossy Drude model DNG medium. The causal responses of different spectral regimes of the medium with positive or negative refractive indices are studied by varying the carrier frequency of narrowband pulse excitations. The smooth transition of the phenomena associated with a DNG medium from its early-time nondispersive behavior to its late-time monochromatic response is explored with wideband pulse excitations. These FDTD results show conclusively that the square root choice leading to a negative index of refraction and positive wave impedance is the correct one, and that this choice is consistent with the overall causality of the response. An analytical, exact frequency domain solution to the scattering of a wave from a DNG slab is also given and is used to characterize several physical effects. This solution is independent of the choice of the square roots for the index of refraction and the wave impedance, and thus avoids any controversy that may arise in connection with the signs of these constituents. The DNG slab solution is used to critically examine the perfect lens concept suggested recently by Pendry. It is shown that the perfect lens effect exists only under the special case of a DNG medium with {$\epsilon$}({$\omega$})={$\mu$}({$\omega$})=-1 that is both lossless and nondispersive. Otherwise, the closed form solutions for the field structure reveal that the DNG slab converts an incident spherical wave into a localized beam field whose parameters depend on the values of {$\epsilon$} and {$\mu$}. This beam field is characterized with a paraxial approximation of the exact DNG slab solution. These monochromatic concepts are again explored numerically via a causal two-dimensional FDTD simulation of the scattering of a pulsed cylindrical wave by a matched, lossy Drude model DNG slab. These FDTD results demonstrate conclusively that the monochromatic electromagnetic power flow through the DNG slab is channeled into beams rather then being focused and, hence, the Pendry perfect lens effect is not realizable with any realistic metamaterial.},

The coating consists of a heterogeneous anisotropic material deduced from a geometrical transformation as first proposed by Pendry [Science 312, 1780 (2006)]. We analyze the electromagnetic response of the cloak in the presence of an electric line source in p polarization and a loop of magnetic current in s polarization. We find that the electromagnetic field radiated by such a source located a fraction of a wavelength from the cloak is perturbed by less than 1\%. When the source lies in the coating, it seems to radiate from a shifted location.},
