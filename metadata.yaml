  We present a genetic algorithm framework that make use surrogate modelling
  to reduce the computational time of the optimization process. We conduct a convergence analysis
  for various benchmarks functions, exploring the influence of the type of metamodels
  and their hyperparameters.
  This framework is finally applied to the design of optical devices, namely a multilayer filter and a
  metagrating, hence demonstrating a rapid and reliable tool for the engineering of
  electromagnetic functionalities in nanophotonics and microwave.
